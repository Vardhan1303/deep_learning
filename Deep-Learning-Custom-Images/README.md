# 🐾 Deep Learning with Custom Images 🖥️

### 🏆 Part of the Udemy Course: [Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-537bb748-f614-4175-803c-3dcc6529c1a7/)

## 📂 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Deep Learning with Custom Images** project! 🚀 In this project, we use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images of cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶.

This project was completed as part of the Udemy course, where I learned how to:
- 📊 Preprocess large datasets of image files.
- 🛠️ Design and train CNN models with TensorFlow/Keras.
- 📈 Evaluate and visualize model performance effectively.

## 📸 Dataset Information
### 🔗 Original Data Source:
[Microsoft Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)  

### 🎯 Kaggle Competition:
[Dogs vs Cats Redux](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)  

### 📦 Dataset Details:
- 🐾 **25,000 Images**:
  - 🐕 **12,500 Dogs** 🐶
  - 🐈 **12,500 Cats** 🐱
- Files are numbered from `0` to `12,499` for both categories.

### ⚠️ Note:
The dataset has **not been uploaded to this repository** due to its large size. You can download it directly from the [Microsoft Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765) or [Kaggle Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition).

### 🔍 Why It's Interesting:
- **Batch Processing**: The dataset is too large to load into memory as a single array. Instead, we feed data in **batches** during training.  
- **Real Image Files**: We deal directly with image files, providing practical experience in handling image datasets.

## 📚 Key Features of the Project
- ✅ Loading and preprocessing large image datasets efficiently.
- ✅ Building and training CNN models for binary image classification.
- ✅ Visualizing the model’s performance with metrics and sample predictions.
